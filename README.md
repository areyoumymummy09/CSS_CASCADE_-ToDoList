CSS CASCADE, SELECTION &amp; PSEUDO SELECTORS

This assignment creates a daily checklist web page with three sections: Morning, Afternoon, and Night. Each section contains a list of tasks to be completed, such as washing face, making the bed, or doing homework. Tasks are represented as list items with checkboxes that users can mark as completed. The page structure includes a header with the title "Daily Checklist - Elaine Yi Ting" and links to an external CSS stylesheet for styling.
